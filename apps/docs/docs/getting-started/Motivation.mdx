# Motivation

## Why Gravis?
Gravis is a React UI library that is designed for modern dashboard applications as seen in GIC's many internal digital products and applications.

Many developers and content producers at GIC are not front-end engineers nor designers, hence expecting them to come up with their own designs for their open source project websites will be additional work on top of the act of preparing their project and writing the necessary documentation.
As a design framework, Gravis offers consistent styles for different common user interfaces components - grid, buttons, forms, etc.
It is ready to use out-of-the-box with minimal configurations, allowing users to easily selecting and customising exactly what they need.

The main difference between Gravis and existing CSS frameworks (e.g. Antd) is that it's built with a modern theming approach, modern tooling
which makes it perfect for building modern applications at consistency and scale.

Secondly, an existing problem with using third-party components on your website that leverages a different CSS framework is that the styles (and hence visual appearance) are not compatible with each other.
By creating a design framework where design and its corresponding components are a first class citizen,
future applications can easily adopt the same style by extending Gravis's base theme variables, resulting in a consistent style
even though components are extended externally.
