# Introduction to Gravis
_Develop fast, powerful web apps with Gravis-OS._

### Gravis is a React UI library that provides developers with the components needed to get started with building a modern application.
Gravis-OS is an opinionated library built on top of React, Next, Supabase, and MUI. It is a zero-config library optimised for building modern web applications and dashboards at speed.

## Motivation
We spend too much time recreating mundane and repetitive components e.g. LoginForms, DashboardLayouts, etc. when building new web applications. Existing javascript libraries such as Next, Material, Supabase, etc. are brilliant in their own ways, but each require extensive integration time when being put together in a new application.

Gravis-OS seeks to accelerate custom software development by integrating across a specific stack to deliver a higher abstraction framework for building applications at speed.
